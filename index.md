## Getting started

Test

## BlenderFDS, full control over the FDS input file

BlenderFDS helps you build complex FDS models *faster*,
because it eases geometric data entry with powerful 3D editing tools, but you remain in full control over all the input parameters, as BlenderFDS does not hide the FDS complexity and flexibility.

You can import CAD models and existing FDS input files,
and quickly adapt them to your needs.

BlenderFDS is developed in Python
as a free and open source [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) addon,
and it is fully scriptable.

BlenderFDS is available for [MS Windows, MacOSX, Linux](https://github.com/firetools/blenderfds/wiki/Installing).

## What is FDS?

[NIST Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS)](https://pages.nist.gov/fds-smv/)
is a large-eddy simulation (LES) code for low-speed flows,
with an emphasis on smoke and heat transport from fires.

## What is Blender?

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) is the free and open source 3D creation suite.
It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline from modelling to visualisation,
and BlenderFDS makes use of its 3D modeling tools.

## A family of open tools for FDS

Another companion tool is [qgis2fds](https://github.com/firetools/qgis2fds/wiki), an open [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org) plugin
that exports terrains and landuse for wildfire simulation and atmospheric dispersion of fire pollutants.
The resulting FDS file can be imported to BlenderFDS for further customization.

## Funded by the WUIFI-21 project

The development of BlenderFDS is funded by a grant from
the [Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation](https://www.esteri.it/).
